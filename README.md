# Frameworkless Basic Web Application Kata
### This application has been created for the second Quorum Review, as part of MYOB's Future Makers Academy acceleration program.

# Requirements
It's the late 1990s and the internet has just begun to flourish. You have a brilliant idea to build a Hello World web application however there are no MVC frameworks for you to use. Your mission is to implement a basic Hello World web application without using any frameworks. 

When calling the web application from a browser it should return a greeting with your name and the current date/time of the server. For instance, if your name was Bob when hitting the web server (http://localhost:8080) the browser would display "Hello Bob - the time on the server is 10:48pm on 14 March 2018" 

_(Yes, we know we said you were in the 1990s... but we want you to use your current servers date/time ;-))_

Oh, and of course you are one of those new age eXtreme programmers so you need to have appropriate tests! To make your life easier we have got starting points for Java and C#  

## To summarise 

* Keep with standard libraries, don't use frameworks like Spring/Dropwizard or equivalent  
* Try implement all the dispatching code manually.  
* Include in your solution a test case for proving that the "greeting" portion of the system is functioning correctly.  

If you are working in C#, a trivial web server that doesn't rely on
ASP.NET Core follows. Note that it handles a single request at a time,
synchronously. Converting it to be asynchronous, so as to be able to handle
more than one request simultaneously, is a useful future exercise.

~~~
var server = new HttpListener();
server.Prefixes.Add("http://localhost:8080/");
server.Start();
while (true)
{
    var context = server.GetContext();  // Gets the request
    Console.WriteLine($"{context.Request.HttpMethod} {context.Request.Url}");
    var buffer = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello");
    context.Response.ContentLength64 = buffer.Length;
    context.Response.OutputStream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);  // forces send of response
}
server.Stop();  // never reached...
~~~

# Enhancements

Their requirements are as follows:

* By default your web application should just great you with your name and the date however (assume for these examples your name is Bob)
* You should be able to add additional people to the list. For example, say you want to add Mary to your hello world, after calling the appropriate http requests it should display "Hello Bob and Mary - the time on the server is 10:59pm on 14 March 2018" _(Yes, we know that's no the late 1990's!)
* You should then be able to add Sue to your hello world, "Hello Bob, Mary and Sue - the time on the server is 10:59pm on 14 March 2018"
* You can also remove people from the greeting, you could remove Mary while keeping Sue , "Hello Bob & Sue - the time on the server is 11:01pm on 14 March 2018"
* You should be able to have a custom url to get just a list of people's names without the greetings
* You should be able to change someones name, if you have already added Sue and Sue now want's to be called Dave, you should be able to do that.
* You can never remove yourself from the world - in this world Bob will always be there, in your world you should always be there!
* You can also assume that everyone in your hello world has a unique name, there is only ever one Bob, one Dave, one Mary, etc.
* You can have a UI to show the state of the resource, but you donâ€™t need to worry about UI forms for adding/updating/removing people, just interact using curl or postman or your http tool of choice to send http requests to modify the state of the resource.

Oh, and of course you are still a big believer of automated tests (this is sounding less and less like the 90's) so you need to have appropriate tests for all important logic!

## Usage
### Accessing the deployed application
https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/

### GET Requests
Using Postman or curl, making a GET request to the [root](https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/) path will return a greeting containing the name of the application owner and other names in the repository, along with the date and time on the server as below:
```
Hello Martyna and Bob - the time on the server is 3:45 AM on 13 January 2121
```

A GET request to the [/users](https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/users) endpoint will return the names held in the repository
```
Martyna, Bob
```
### POST Requests
https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/users <br/>
All POST requests to the [/users](https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/users) path will only be handled using x-www-form-urlencoded
The `Name` key-pair is required to add a new name to the repository.
A successful POST request will return a message that name has been added.
```
Bob has been added
```
### DELETE Requests
https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/users/bob <br/>
All DELETE requests to the [/users/<user name>](https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/users) path will only be handled using x-www-form-urlencoded
A successful DELETE request will return a message that name has been added.
```
Bob has been removed from the list
```
### PUT Requests
https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/users/bob <br/>
All PUT requests to the [/users/<user name>](https://martyna-web-app.svc.platform.myobdev.com/users) path will only be handled using x-www-form-urlencoded
The `Name` key-pair is required to update a name in the repository.
A successful PUT request will return a message that name has been updated.
```
Bob has been updated to Terry
```

### Error Codes
If attempting to add a name that is already in the user list, a 403 (Forbidden) status code will be returned with the custom message below:
```
sorry that can't be done
```
If there is no body in the request, a 400  (Bad Request) status code will be returned with the custom message below:
```
no body found
```
